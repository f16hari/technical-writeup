# How to submit an HTML FORM to the sever without RELOADING or REDIRECTING to the server page ?

Seeing the title of this write up you may be wondering what is the big deal in form submission ?

But the thing that I want to convey is that the predominant way of submitting the form is an legacy way in which you just include an form tag of the HTML like the following
```HTML
<from action="sampleServerPage" method="get/post">
  ....
</form>
```
The above way of submitting details to the server causes the page to redirect to the `sampleSeverPage` in the `action` tag along with the loss of control of the current page. This might not be a big concern when working on simple web apps that require less desktop like functionality.
So, I am going to discuss a method that uses `Ajax` and `JQuery` to allow us to asynchronusly submit the data to the server without loosing control over the current page
for the implementation of the server functionality I will be using `PHP ^5.0.6`
consider the `<form>` be declared as
```HTML
```
